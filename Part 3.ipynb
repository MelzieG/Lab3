    "1/4 WPs are made out of birefringent material, which means the refractive index changes depending on the orientation of the components of the incoming SOP. This means one component of the light will be travelling faster than the other, creating a phase shift between the two. 1/4 WPs are made such that the phase shift between the two waves is $\\pi/2$, ie there is a 1/4 wave difference between the two, which explains the name. The reason why light at 45° to a 1/4 WP becomes circularly polarised is because one of the components will now have the form of a sine wave, while the other will still be a cosine wave (as $\\cos(\\theta - \\pi/2) = \\sin(\\theta)$). This means the electric field of the beam will basically draw the unit circle if the amplitude is normalised (which comes back to its definition), and so the SOP is circular."
