Note that this 1/2 WP only works for our laser ($633 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$) because of how it is constructed \n",

This is different from the method used previously (where we used the minimum transmission to set up), because the minimum transmission is 45&deg; for the 1/2 WP, which falls between graduations, making the calibration less precise. I'll perhaps find a better method later on."

    "The angle of the analyser when the transmission is maximal is the angle of the SOP incident on the analyser (which is the whole point of the analyser, and comes from Malus' law). As the SOP incident to the 1/2 WP is at 0&deg;, we conclude that the 1/2 WP must make the polarisation rotate by twice its angle (ie the angle between the first transmission axis and the SOP). This is equivalent to saying that the incoming SOP is reflected with respect to the transmission axis. For example, for a 10 &deg; angle of the 1/2 WP, we get a final SOP of 20 &deg;. Further, from the 1st and last line of the table (1/2 WP angle of 0 and 90 &deg;), we see that, as the two transmission axes have the same power output, we get the same results.\n",
