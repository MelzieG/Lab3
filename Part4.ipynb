For $\\epsilon = 0$, this means we need the polariser to polarise the laser beam, the 1/2 WP to set the initial angle of the SOP, the 1/4 WP under study and the analyser. To achieve $\\epsilon = -90^ \\circ$, we have to add another 1/4 WP with its fast axis aligned with the x-axis, which comes back to the properties of the 1/4 WP."
