    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, in table 2, all the erors for $\\delta$ are consistent with the fact that we are studying a 1/4 WP, as their absolute value is similar to $90^\\circ$. Which is the phase difference between the orthogonal components of the SOP. However, the values calculated for 45 and -45&deg; are much closer to the real value ($\\approx 2 \\%$ difference), while the other two are further away ($\\approx 3 \\%$ difference), this is not much, but nevertheless indicates that the way we set the $\\pm 45$ SOPs (using the method in paragraph 4) is more precise that setting the 1/2 WP at half the desired angle, as we can get a precision of less than a degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the 45¬∞ angle**: $\\psi$ should be undefined, as discussed earlier. However, our values are not perfect, and so it gives back an angle. This is ok, because it indicates that $|s_1| \\approx |s_2|$ (which should both equal 0 in a perfect situation). $\\chi$ should equal 45¬∞ here, as this is right circularly polarised light, which gives a large difference of 15% with the measured value. The gradient of $\\arctan(x)$ is very steep at 1, its expected value, which means the function is very sensitive to small deviations there. This propagates to our value of $a/b$, which is quite distant from its expected value of 1 for circularly polarised light (more than 20%). However, $E_x/E_y = 1$, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the -45¬∞ angle**: The same things can be said for this angle, and most of it has already been discussed in the Data Analysis part. Something to note is that $E_x/E_y = 1$, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the -20¬∞ angle**: $\\psi$, the angle of orientation, is very small, which indicates that the long axis is nearly aligned with the x-axis, which is what I would expect for small angles. Further, $\\chi$ and $\\delta$ are negative, which indicates that the beam rotates to the left, which is consistent with the fact that this angle is negative. Finally, $b/a$ is quite close to 0.5. This is because we're about halfway between circularly polarised anf linearly polarised light (which would have $b/a = 0$), and so the ratio between the two axes of the ellipse would be 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the 60¬∞ angle**: $\\psi$ is nearly 90¬∞. This may be because we are approaching a 90¬∞ angle, where linearly polarised light *perpendicular* to the x-axis is created. $\\chi$ and $\\delta$ are positive, which indicates that the beam rotates to the right, which is consistent with the fact that this angle is positive. $b/a$ is closer to 1 than it is to 0.5, which is consistent with the fact that $60 < 72.5$, where we would expect a value of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, all our errors are underestimates. One reason I can find is that, because it takes a long time to adjust the $\\pm 45^\\circ$ SOP, I didn't change it between the measurements sets, which means I only took care of the random error introduced by the detector signal and the analyser angle. Another way of putting it is that there would be a systematic error on the SOP angle leaving the 1/2 WP."

    "\n",
    "This firstly shows that the transmission changes depending on how bent the plate is. This means strain on some material (usually isotropic) will cause a change in polarisation to change. In other words, strain will cause double refraction, ie birefringence. Note that this birefringence is only caused by stress/strain, as Perspex is a polymer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)), and so shouldn't exhibit birefringence. We see that the change in transmission is a lot bigger when the plate is at 50% transmission (at rest) than when it is at maximal or minimal transmission. I wasn't able to find why. Stress/strain birefringence can also be seen for glass (https://www.vedantu.com/physics/double-refraction) and is used to map out the stress/strain in different parts of an object. It is the basis for the study of photoelasticity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelasticity) (more on that later)."
